# EMDR-for-browsers

> Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing is a form of therapy for PTSD and anxiety.

This html file shows a blinking black dot and has alternating beeps, and is configurable through a slider.

You can download the the zip here, unpack it in a folder, and click the [**start.html**](https://hosteren.github.io/EMDR-for-browsers/start.html) to open it in your default browser.

## **How to use**

The way this form of therapy is supposed to work is by concentrating on a painful memory while following the square from side to side. Then, with your arms across your torso, in a manner where you are able to tap your opposite shoulder, tap each shoulder corresponding to the beeps. Or whatever works for you.

## **The effect**

The effect on PTSD when done right can be substantiel. Ten minutes doing this, with a couple of pauses and I was free of associating some good music to a relationship I had with a satan like entity.

## **Disclaimer**

I just want to make the world a better place. Be careful and be the best you.
